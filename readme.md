# PHP EC Recover

This library is based heavily on 2 different projects.
- https://github.com/tuaris/CryptoCurrencyPHP
- https://github.com/wmh/php-ecrecover

Largely this project wraps up these projects into a more modern and usable form. 
git submodules aren't the best way to include code >.>
